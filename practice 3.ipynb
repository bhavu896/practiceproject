    "# Glass Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset description\n",
    "This is a Glass Identification Data Set from UCI. It contains 10 attributes including id. The response is glass type(discrete 7 values) The study of the classification of types of glass was motivated by the criminological investigation. At the scene of the crime, the glass left can be used as evidence...if it is correctly identified!\n",

    "Goal:-\n",
    "The goal of the project is to find the type of glass based on the characteristics of the new glass. To perform preprocessing of the dataset provided for the glass type and get inferences from it Through Data analysis and Visualization Then Train Machine Learning Models/Algorithms.\n",
